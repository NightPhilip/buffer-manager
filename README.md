Database Management System (DBMS) Project
This project implements a basic yet comprehensive Database Management System (DBMS) in C++, designed to provide foundational functionalities such as buffer management, error handling, and page management. It's structured to offer a modular approach to database management, allowing for scalability and further development.

Features
Buffer Management: Implemented in buf.C and buf.h, this component manages the buffer pool, including allocation, deallocation, and access operations, ensuring efficient memory usage.
Hashing for Buffer Management: The bufHash.C module implements hashing functionality to quickly map page numbers to buffer slots, optimizing retrieval times.
Database Operations: Core database functionalities, such as creation, deletion, and access, are encapsulated in db.C and db.h, providing the interface for managing database records.
Error Handling: Robust error handling capabilities are implemented in error.C and error.h, designed to capture and report errors throughout the system.
Page Management: The page.C and page.h files handle the management of pages within the database, including reading, writing, and organizing data at the page level.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
Make (for building the project)
Building the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Use the makefile provided (assuming one is available) to compile the project. If not, compile each .C file manually using your C++ compiler. For example:
bash
Copy code
g++ -o dbms buf.C bufHash.C db.C error.C page.C -I.
Running the Application
After building the project, you can run the application using:

bash
Copy code
./dbms
